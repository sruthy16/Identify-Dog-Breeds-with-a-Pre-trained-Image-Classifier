Questions regarding Uploaded Image Classification:

1. Did the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed? 
If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: 
Yes, the three model architectures classified the breed of dog in Great_dane_05320.jpg (Dog_01.jpg)
to be the same breed: "great dane".

2. Did each of the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed 
of dog as that model architecture classified Dog_02.jpg? If not, report the differences in the 
classifications.

Answer:
Yes, the three model architectures classified the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed of 
dog as that model architecture classified Dog_02.jpg. I used Great_dane_05320.jpg (Dog_01.jpg) and took
its mirrored image Great_dane_05320 copy.jpg (Dog_02.jpg). All three model architectures correctly 
classified the breed for both images to be "great dane".

3. Did the three model architectures correctly classify Animal_Name_01.jpg and Object_Name_01.jpg to 
not be dogs? If not, report the misclassifications.

Answer: 
Yes, the three model architectures correctly classified Rabbit_002.jpg (Animal_Name_01.jpg) and 
coffee_mug.jpg (Object_Name_01.jpg) to not be dogs. Additionally, for all three model architectures in both 
the PetLabelDog and ClassLabelDog were set to 0. As well as the calculated statistics from 
calculates_results_stats() function returned that the number of dog images is two and the number 
of not dog images is two. 

4. Based upon your answers for questions 1. - 3. above, select the model architecture that you feel did 
the best at classifying the four uploaded images. Describe why you selected that model architecture as 
the best on uploaded image classification.

Answer:
The model architecture tha I feel best classified the four uploaded images was the AlexNet CNN model 
architecture. Overall, AlexNet and ResNet both had similar results and classified better than VGG. However, 
the total elapsed time for AlexNet was only 24 seconds, while ResNet took 25 seconds. On the other hand, 
VGG took 27 seconds. VGG had only 3 matches failed to classify coffee_mug.jpg as a "coffee mug" instead 
classified it as "eggnog" which both AlexNet and ResNet were able to classify successfully as "coffee mug". 
Therefore, due to the number of matches and time taken, AlexNet was the best model architecture on 
uploaded image classification.
